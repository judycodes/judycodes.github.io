====================

## Hello world!

This is my attempt at understanding and exploring the world of Github and Code. 

I am a beginner to coding and only gained exposure to HTML and CSS through Project Code at NYPL. 
My first independent efforts at using HTML and CSS could be viewed <a href="https://reallytru.github.io/">right here.</a>
In that program, I also worked with other new coders to create this <a href="https://reallytru.github.io/groupproject/">group project</a>

Since then, I have been fascinated by coding and pursued more knowledge. 
Eventually, I learned about responsive web design and challenged my skills to create this website about <a href="https://reallytru.github.io/thecentralline/">New York's Subway System.</a>
I was not alone in my progress. I continued to work with others to create <a href="https://reallytru.github.io/projectcodeii/">a homepage for the program I participated in.</a>

I continue to improve and learn code in the hopes of entering the programming field.

Soon, I will present a customized portfolio of my projects and coding adventures here @ <a href="http://judycodes.github.io/">judycodes on github.</a>
