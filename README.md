## About Me

As a teacher and software engineer, I am driven by my desire to help others succeed in their endeavors. Leveraging my toolkit of soft skills, I translate complex ideas and code into easily digestible and approachable solutions that anticipate and satisfy client needs. Through collaboration, study, and resolve, I build useful applications that empower lives and make positive impact in overlooked fields.
