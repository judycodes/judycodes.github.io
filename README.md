====================

## Hello world!

This is my attempt at understanding and exploring the world of Github and Code. 

I am a beginner to coding and only gained exposure to HTML and CSS through Project Code at NYPL. 
Since then, I have been fascinated by coding and pursued more knowledge. 
I have been self-studying gradually through a variety of online means, such as FreeCodeCamp, Codecademy, Udemy, SoloLearn, and countless others. I continue to improve and learn code in the hopes of entering the programming field.

Soon, I will present a customized portfolio of my projects and coding adventures here @ <a href="http://judycodes.github.io/">judycodes on github.</a> In the meantime, you can check out the portfolio I created to meet the FreeCodeCamp Responsive Web Design Certification (300 hours) requirements: <a href="https://judycodes.github.io/codelinked/">HERE.</a>
