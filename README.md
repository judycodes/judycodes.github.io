====================

## Hello world!

This is my attempt at understanding and exploring the world of Github and Code. 

I am a beginner to coding and only gained exposure to HTML and CSS through Project Code at NYPL. 
My first independent efforts at using HTML and CSS could be viewed at: https://reallytru.github.io/
In that program, I also worked with other new coders to create this: https://reallytru.github.io/groupproject/

Since then, I have been fascinated by coding and pursued more knowledge. 
Eventually, I learned about responsive web design and challenged my skills to create this website: https://reallytru.github.io/thecentralline/
I was not alone in my progress. I continued to work with others to create: https://reallytru.github.io/projectcodeii/

I continue to improve and learn code in the hopes to enter the programming field.

Soon, I will present a customized portfolio of my projects and coding adventures here:
